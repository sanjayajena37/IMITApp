The first realization that should dawn on a student who got admitted into an institute of higher learning is that s/he is one from a small percentage of 10 - 11% youth who are fortunate to get this opportunity. An educated and informed person is an asset to the society and the nation. We should be very conscious of our duties and responsibilities more so when substantial amount of taxpayersâ€™ money is invested in educating us. At the same time, making a right choice of career by enrolling into a post graduate program or course is critical to the trajectory of success. One should carefully evaluate all options; do due diligence and homework, avail expert opinion and counseling before making the final choice. It is not necessary to be cowed down by peer pressure; unsolicited advice offered with a blind eye to inherent talent and inclination of the student. The goodwill, love, care and guidance of parents and guardians pave the way for academic achievements and good citizenship. The faculty members play a vital role in building the career and lives of their students not only by imparting knowledge and skills but being mentors to them. Understanding the inner psyche of a student and channelizing his/her energies in the right direction is a challenge, every faculty need to accept. Our faculty should focus on giving not only theoretical insights but also exposure to applications of knowledge in improvement of real world practices.
